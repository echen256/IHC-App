# IHC-App

Application for storing Immunohistonechemistry (IHC) experiment results and for automating test record printing

This application aims to create a friendly user interface for lab technicians to record and store their immunohistonechemistry
experiment data. Users will be able to store the name,catalog number, lot number, date of experiment and other information pertaining to each
slide they use.

This application utilizes a React frontend to display and receive user information and a Express / MySQL backend to manage data storage.

This is a good primer for IHC.
